# Project Summary
**Part I : Exploratory Data Analysis** 

Data exploration and summary of the data with basic descriptive statistics

**Part II : Rank-Based Recommendations** 

User recommendation of articles based on those that have incurred the most interactions. This rank-based recommendation system is best utilized for new users, who have no features known about them.

**Part III: User-User Based Collaborative Filtering** 

Examination of users and the similarity of their interactions with various items. Recommendations can thus be made to similar users in what's known as user-user based collaborative filtering.

**Part IV: Content Based Recommendations** 

(EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)

**Part V: Matrix Factorization** 

Matrix decomposition of user-user interactions to predict new articles an individual might interact with.
